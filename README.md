# Admin Panel Project

This project is mostly about working on a admin panel that has the list of orders, products, and users where you can also manage the order status and product list. This is utilizing Laravel web framework, Bootstrap, and MySQL to get everything up and running. This is only having the admin panel created for the E-Commerce project that I will be working on once this one is completed.
